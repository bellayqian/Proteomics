### Proteomics Biomarker Analysis

#### Project Overview
This project performs longitudinal and non-longitudinal analysis of proteomics data to identify biomarkers, using various statistical methods.

#### Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for SomaScan and LC-MS data
- Differential expression analysis using RolDE, ROTS, and Limma
- Comparison of longitudinal and non-longitudinal results
- Visualization tools including heatmaps, volcano plots, and change-from-baseline plots
- Integration with RNA-seq data
- Interactive visualization via R Shiny app

#### Input Data
- Sample metadata (treatment groups, animal IDs, timepoints)
- Expression matrix (protein levels for each sample)

#### Output
- Lists of potential biomarker proteins
- Visualization outputs (heatmaps, volcano plots, PCA plots)
- Excel files with detailed results
- RDS files with processed data
